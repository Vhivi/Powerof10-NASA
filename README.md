# The Power of 10: Rules for Developing Safety-Critical Code

This repository contains two files:

- `Powerof10-original.md`: This file lists the original 10 programming rules from NASA.
- `Powerof10-python.md`: This file provides an adaptation of the original rules for Python programming.

After coming across an article discussing NASA's 10 programming rules, I thought it would be interesting to adapt them for the Python language. That's what I'm trying to do in the `Powerof10-python.md` file.

Disclaimer: This repository has no pretensions, other than sharing a personal and/or subjective adaptation of NASA's programming rules for the Python language (the language I use the most).

This repository is open to contribution. Feel free to explore and contribute to this repository, especially by proposing adaptations for other programming languages if you wish.
