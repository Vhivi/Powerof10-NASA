# The Power of 10: Rules for Developing Safety-Critical Code

This repository contains two files:

- `Powerof10-original.md`: This file lists the original 10 programming rules from NASA.
- `Powerof10-python.md`: This file provides an adaptation of the original rules for Python programming.

After coming across an article discussing NASA's 10 programming rules, I thought it would be interesting to adapt them for the Python language. That's what I'm trying to do in the `Powerof10-python.md` file.

:warning: Disclaimer: This repository has no pretensions, other than sharing a personal and/or subjective adaptation of NASA's programming rules for the Python language (the language I use the most). :warning:

After creating the adaptation of NASA's programming rules for the Python language, I thought it would be interesting to share them. But also to adapt them for other programming languages. That's why this repository is open to contribution. Feel free to explore and contribute to this repository, especially by proposing adaptations for other programming languages if you wish.
